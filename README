cbm - display in real time the network traffic speed
----------------------------------------------------

The Color Bandwidth Meter (CBM) is a small program to display the traffic
currently flowing through the network devices in a simple curses-based GUI.
The traffic for all interfaces include values as receive, transfer and total
Bytes/s or bits/s (or its multiples as KB/s and Kb/s).

It is useful for Internet or LAN speed tests, measuring the velocity of a
link, to establish a benchmark or to monitor your connections. CBM can be
used with virtual, wired or wireless networks.
